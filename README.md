## ⚙️ Environment Configuration

### Backend

Create a local `.env` file from `.env.example`:

```env
SECRET_KEY=replace-with-a-long-random-secret
JWT_ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=60
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./budgetbuddy.db
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://127.0.0.1:5173
```

The actual `.env` file is intentionally ignored by Git.

### Frontend

Create `client/.env` from `client/.env.example`:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

For deployment, this value should point to the deployed HTTPS backend.

---

## 🗃️ Database Migrations

Alembic is configured for schema migrations.

Check the current migration:

```bash
alembic current
```

Apply migrations:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

Create a new migration after model changes:

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe change"
```

---

## ▶️ Run Locally

### Backend

From the project root:

```bash
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Backend:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Health check:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
```

Swagger documentation:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

## 🧪 Local Verification

The application has been locally verified and smoke-tested for:

- Backend startup and health endpoint
- JWT authentication
- Expense and income operations
- Budget and notification functionality
- Savings goals
- Analytics data flow
- PDF and Excel report generation
- Frontend production build with `npm run build`
- Environment-based frontend API configuration
- User data ownership checks
- Profile persistence and Alembic migration
- Notification read/unread flow and scheduled notification generation
- RBAC guard behavior
- Pytest smoke tests (`pytest -q`)

---

## 🚀 Production Readiness

The codebase includes production-oriented configuration for:

- Environment-based secrets and configuration
- PostgreSQL connection support
- Alembic migrations
- Environment-based CORS
- Environment-based frontend API URL
- Health checking
- Production dependency declaration
- Git-safe environment examples
- Ignoring local databases, virtual environments, build output, and generated reports

Deployment itself is intentionally kept separate from local development verification. No deployment is included in this completion pass.
